## Part 3: evaluating complex expressions

You have now already made a simple language, able to evaluate nested arithmetic expressions. It is time to add the ability to use control structures. 

For our language, an `if` statement will suffice. The `if` takes three arguments. The first one is the predicate `p`, which is always evaluated. The second **or** third argument is then evaluated and returned depending on the value of `p`.

### Make it happen!

Go on, you know what to do.

```bash
mvn -Dtest=ExpressionTests test
```

### What's next?

Go to [part 4](4.md) where we add environments that'll enable us to work with variables.
