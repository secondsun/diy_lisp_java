## Part 4: working with variables

So far, our interpreted language is only able do deal with expressions one by one. In a real programming language, we need to be able to store intermediate results in variables, and then later to look them up from the environment.

We will start by implementing the `Environment` class (which can be found in `diylisp/types.py`). Then we'll extend `evaluate` to handle expressions using defined variables, and the creation of new variables with the `define` form.

Run the tests, and get going!

```bash
nosetests tests/test_4_working_with_variables_and_environments.py --stop
```

### What's next?

In [part 5](5.md) the environments we just implemented enable us to make lexically scoped functions.
