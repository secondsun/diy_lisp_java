## Part 5: functions

This part is the one you might have been waiting for. It's time to add functions to our little language.

Functions are created with the `lambda` form, which returns an instance of `Closure`. The first few tests guide you to implement the `lambda` form correctly. 

The next tests concern calling functions. A function call happens when we evaluate a list in which the first element is a function closure.

Finally, we handle some situations where function calls are done incorrectly, and make sure we give appropriate errors.

### Make it happen!

This is probably the most difficult part of making the language, so don't worry if it takes a bit longer than the previous parts.

```bash
mvn test=FunctionsTest test
```

### What's next?

Ready for the last part of the language? In [part 6](6.md) we add a ways to work with lists.
